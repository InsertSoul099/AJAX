These are all temporary animations for the default Manniquin character.

Any animations not in a folder is used for the default, with no changes.

Animations in a folder are temp animations for those characters until the models and real animations are in. If there is an animation missing from the folder, assume it uses animations frim the default files you see here.

Confused? Ask Aidan.
