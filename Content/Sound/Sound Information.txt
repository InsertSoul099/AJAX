All foley sounds go together in the Foley folder until further notice.

--------------------

All edited sounds are to be normalized to -11dB!

--------------------

Each sound will have at least 1 Subject folder, but if you feel there are too many variations of a sound (i.e. 20 footstep sounds for 1 character) you can add a further Subject folder.

Example:
...Sound/BetaSFX/Atlas/Footsteps/SE_SE_Atlas_BasicFootstep_1
